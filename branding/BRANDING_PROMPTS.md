## Prompt 1: Title Card (16:9 Landscape)

**Dimensions:** 1536 x 1024 pixels  
**Purpose:** GitHub README header, social media banner

```
A futuristic tech visualization showing transformation of chaotic data into organized documentation. On the left side, floating fragments of code, tool icons, timestamps, and error messages swirl in disorganized streams of light. In the center, a glowing cyan crystalline structure acts as a processing core, channeling and organizing the chaos. On the right side, clean stacked document pages emerge, perfectly aligned with headers and tables visible. The scene is set against a deep navy space background (#0a0e27) with cyan (#00d4ff) and purple (#8b5cf6) energy streams. Abstract circuit patterns pulse in the background. Professional tech aesthetic, no text, cinematic lighting with volumetric rays, 8k quality.

## Prompt 2: Logo Mark (1:1 Square)

**Dimensions:** 1024 x 1024 pixels  
**Purpose:** App icon, avatar, favicon base

```
A minimalist abstract logo mark representing document generation from data streams. A geometric stylized document page icon composed of clean angular lines, with three flowing data streams entering from the left side and transforming into organized horizontal lines within the document shape. The streams transition from chaotic curves to straight ordered lines as they enter the document. Cyan (#00d4ff) glowing streams against dark navy (#0a0e27) background. The document shape has subtle purple (#8b5cf6) glow edges. Ultra clean vector-style design with sharp edges, no text, centered composition, corporate tech aesthetic, suitable for small display sizes.
```

## Prompt 3: Horizontal Logo (3:1 Wide)

**Dimensions:** 1536 x 512 pixels  
**Purpose:** Website header, wide banner

```
Wide horizontal tech banner showing the concept of session documentation automation. On the left, a circular node emits spiraling streams of data particles - small icons representing tools, files, and timestamps. These streams flow horizontally across the image, passing through a series of floating translucent processing gates that organize and align them. On the right, the streams converge into a perfectly formatted document hologram with visible markdown headers and bullet points. Deep navy space background (#0a0e27) with cyan (#00d4ff) particle streams and purple (#8b5cf6) processing gates. Subtle grid lines in background suggest data structure. Panoramic composition, no text, tech corporate style, ambient lighting.

## Prompt 4: App Icon (1:1 Simplified)

**Dimensions:** 512 x 512 pixels  
**Purpose:** Desktop icon, small displays, favicons

```
Ultra-simplified app icon for a documentation tool. A single stylized document page silhouette with a small flowing wave or stream entering from the top-left corner, representing incoming data. The wave transforms into three clean horizontal lines inside the document, representing organized content. Minimal design using only two colors: bright cyan (#00d4ff) for the elements against solid dark navy (#0a0e27) background. No gradients, no text, geometric precision, works at 32x32 pixels, flat design with subtle depth, centered composition.

## Usage Notes

1. **Generate in order** - Title card first for overall aesthetic reference
2. **Maintain consistency** - All images should feel like they belong to the same brand
3. **Test at size** - Especially verify App Icon at small scales
4. **No text** - All text will be added via overlays or separate design tools
5. **Color accuracy** - Adjust in post if DALL-E shifts the color palette

---

## File Naming Convention

After generation, save files as:

- `sessiondocgen_title_card.png` (1536x1024)
- `sessiondocgen_logo_mark.png` (1024x1024)
- `sessiondocgen_horizontal_logo.png` (1536x512)
- `sessiondocgen_app_icon.png` (512x512)

## Brand Guidelines

**DO:**
- Use dark navy backgrounds for consistency with Beacon HQ
- Emphasize the transformation/synthesis concept
- Keep designs clean and professional
- Use cyan as the primary accent

**DON'T:**
- Use busy or cluttered compositions
- Include literal document/paper imagery that looks dated
- Use gradients that clash with the color palette
- Add text directly to generated images
